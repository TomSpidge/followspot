# Followspot

## What is it?
I had a couple of spare projectors at church and decided they if they were set up to cover the whole stage area would work quite nicely as a followspot, just by having a screen with white dots on it moving to cover the necessary area.
I couldn't find anything to do this (though there's some nice effects software that doubles as a gobo).

This is a very simple javascript web page to cover the need. Load it up, set it to fullscreen and off you go.

## Instructions
- The active spot is moved by the mouse and adjusted with the keyboard.
- There are 10 spots in total. Switch between them using the number keys
- 1 is the only visible spot at startup
- They are layered 0 (bottom) to 9 (top) if they overlap
- **v** toggles visibility
- **r, g** & **b** increase the RGB values
- **R, G** & **B** (so, shift+RGB) decreases the RGB values
- **+** & **-** increase and decrease the size of the spot.
